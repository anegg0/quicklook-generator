## Quicklook Generator

## Project description

Quicklook Generator helps you populate a file with `quicklooks` tags while attending a call.


## Who this project is for

This project is intended EXCLUSIVELY for OCL TW, you'd be hard pressed to find any benefit in this utility otherwise.
Also: if you are a malicious actor be aware that this utility has been thoroughly edited to give you access to OSS code.


## Prerequisites

Before using {Project Name}, ensure you have:
* MacOS 12+ 
* Being used to `CLI`
* Being so darn lazy you can't even copy paste those poor `quicklooks` without being triggered

## Install 

``` sh
wget -q -O - https://example.com/install-script-quicklook-generator.sh | bash
```

## Usage 

Run:

``` sh
quicklook-generator input-file.md
```

The generator will output a gorgeous file named:`<{ your-file-name }-but-with-quicklooks-this-time.md>`.

It is recommended to diff the output file with your favorite editor to remove the `quicklooks` you consider unnecessary.
