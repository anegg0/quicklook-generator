## Project description

Quicklook Generator helps you populate a file with `quicklooks` tags.


## Who this project is for
This project is intended EXCLUSIVELY for OCL TW, you'd be hard pressed to find any benefit in this utility otherwise.


## Prerequisites
Before using {Project Name}, ensure you have:
* MacOS 12+ 
* Being used to CLI
* Being so darn lazy, you can't even copy paste those poor `quicklooks` without hating the whole world

## Install 

``` sh
wget 
```

## Usage 

Run:

``` sh
quicklook-generator input-file.md
```

The generator will output a gorgeous file named:`<{ your-file-name }-but-with-quicklooks-this-time.md>`.

It is recommended to diff the output file with your favorite editor to remove the `quicklooks` you consider unnecessary.
